# SPARTAN effort in Agentic AI

We are the Strategic Platform for Autonomous Resilient and Trusted Agents @ NUS (SPARTAN) led by Prof. [Abhik Roychoudhury](https://abhikrc.com/). In our research, we strive to enable secure and trustworthy systems using powerful agentic AI approaches. In line with this, we focus on program analysis approaches, including our strengths in [Automated Program Repair](https://nus-apr.github.io), [Fuzzing](https://nus-tss.github.io/fuzzing/) and Symbolic Execution. These analysis capabilities are added with agents to create more effective agents such as [AutoCodeRover](https://autocoderover.dev). The research on trusted agents, with trust being engendered by analysis techniques, contributes to the themes of autocoding as well as AI Safety ([WATCH VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8B6q8FNC70))
